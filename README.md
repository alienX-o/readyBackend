# Ready to use Backend

This is the backend server to which has on the go functionalities with Node.js, Express, and MySQL. It handles user authentication, profile management, and other core functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - Email & Password Registration with OTP verification.
  - Secure Login with Email/Username and Password.
  - Google OAuth 2.0 for seamless sign-in and sign-up.
- **Account Management:**
  - Password reset functionality via email OTP.
  - User profile picture updates.
  - Secure account deletion, including associated data.
- **API:**
  - RESTful API for all client-server interactions.
  - JWT-based authentication for securing endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) server (or a compatible alternative like MariaDB).

## Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ready-backend
    ```

2.  **Run the setup script:**

    This single command will:
    - Install all required `npm` dependencies.
    - Create a `.env` file and **prompt you for your database credentials**.
    - Connect to your database server and create the database and tables if they don't exist.
    - Remove the existing `.git` directory to clear the template's history.

    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```
    
3.  **Update remaining environment variables:**
    
    The script will handle your database credentials. You still need to open the `.env` file and fill in your specific keys for **Google OAuth**, **Nodemailer**, and the **JWT Secret**.
    
    > **Important:** If the setup script fails, it's likely due to incorrect database credentials. Just run `npm run setup` again and re-enter them.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

This command starts the server with `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server on file changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode

This command starts the server using `node`.

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specified in `.env`).
